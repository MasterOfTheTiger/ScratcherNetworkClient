# ScratcherNetwork Client
Client for ScratcherNetwork based on ScratchNetwork.

ScratchNetwork is non-free and propritary software. So I am going to work on a new version that is free software called ScratcherNetwork. It will use a similar client (due to its ease of use), and it will be fully free and open source.

This project was not started lightly, as I have asked myeducate over and over again to fix this major problem. However, I see no other option.
